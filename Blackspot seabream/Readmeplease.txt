"SPiCT exercises with SoG blackspot seabream target fishery"

Note that this is shared fishery (Spain and Morocco) which take place in the Strait of Gibraltar area
So, is not extrictly ICES 9 (FAO 27.1)...actually is mostly FAO 37.1 (Mediterranean - GFCM) and FAO 34.1 (Atlantic - CECAF)
Anyway, we´d like to deal with this fishery as a sort of "management unit" (species stock identity still unclear)

3 approaches/exercises:
	-Ex.1 (SBR_ex1.Rmd): Long time series by year (1983-2018) with landings and effort info
	-Ex.2 (SBR_ex2.Rmd): Short time series by quarter (2009-2018) with landings and a biomass index proxy (Spanish standardized CPUE from VMS data)
	-Ex.3 (SBR_ex3.Rmd): Previous exercises max-mix ;-)

Ex.1 could also be attemped using biomass index (since 2009), not only effort data (SBR_ex1plus.Rmd) but
don´t show huge improvement

Ex.2 could also be attemped using effort data, not only biomass index (SBR_ex2plus.Rmd) but
don´t show huge improvement

Don´t really know if Ex.3 can be done and/or make any sense!!

Thanks!!!
